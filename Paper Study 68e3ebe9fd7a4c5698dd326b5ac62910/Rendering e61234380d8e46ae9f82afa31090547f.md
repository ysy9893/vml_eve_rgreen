## 1.The Application Stage

Compute shader mode treats the GPU as a highly parallel GPU.

At the end of the app. stage, the geometry to be rendered i fed to the geometry processing stage. —> Producing the *rendering primitives (points, lines, and triangles, that might eventually end up on the scren).* 

## 2.Geometry Processing

A pipeline of functional stages

### 2.1. Vertex Shading

![Untitled](Rendering%20e61234380d8e46ae9f82afa31090547f/Untitled%202.png)

Main tasks: 

1. compute the position for a vetex 

1. *Model space —> world space:
Model transform* to position/orient each model to a *world space* (also possible to have several model transforms associated with a single model to have several  copies (*instances)* of the same model to have diff. locations/orientations/sizes, etc
2. *World space —> view space:
view transform* to place the camera at the origin and aim it. (to make it look in the dir. of the *-ve z-axis, with y-axis pointing upward and the x-axis pointing to the right —>* now at *camera space/view space/ eye spac*

2. evaluate whatever the programmer may like to have as vertex output data, such as a *normal* and *texture coordinates*

*Shading:* The operation of determining the effect of a light on a material.  Involves computing a *shading equation* at various points on the object.

*Projection*

Rendering systems perform *projection* and then clipping, which transforms the view volume into a unit cube (=) *canonical view volume. (*two common projection methods: orthographic (parallel), perspective projection)

### 2.2. Optional Vertex Processing

Few optional stages on the GPU: 

1. Tesselation
    1. appropriate number of triangles are used for objects that covers only a few pixels on the screen (optimization of triangles)
2. Geometry shading
3. Stream output

### 2.3. Clipping

After the projection transform, clipping is performed to crop out objects unseeable by the camera.

Then, *perspective division* is peformed. *Normalized device coordinates.*

### 2.4. Screen Mapping

The clipped primitives are still 3D.

The x and y coordinates of each primitives are transformed to form *screen coordinates.* 

*Window coorindates: screen coordinates + z-coordinates*

## 3. Rasterization

Rasterization: process of converting a continuous object to a discrete representation on a raster grid (pixel grid)

Two functional substages: 1. triangle setup (primitive assembly) 2. triangle traversal

Rasterization (= scan conversion): 

- conversion from 2D vertices in screen space (each with z value (depth value) and various shading info. associated with each vertex) into pixels on the screen
- =  synchronization point between geometry processing and pixel processing, since it is here that triangles are formed from three vertices and eventually sent down to pixel processing.

whether the triangle is considered to overal the pixel depends on how you have set up the GPU’s pipeline. For example, you may use point sampling to determine “insideness”  The simplest case uses a single point sample in the center of each pixel, and so if that center point is inside the triangle then the corresponding pixel is considered inside the triangle as well. You may also use more than one sample per pixel using supersampling or multisampling antialiasing techniques

Rasterization  —> Ray tracing

where, rasterization: for each primitive (e.g. triangle), which pixels light up?

ray tracing: for each pixel, which primitives are seen?

### 3.1. Triangle Setup

the differentials, edge equations, and other data for the triangle are computed. 

### 3.2. Triangle Traversal
