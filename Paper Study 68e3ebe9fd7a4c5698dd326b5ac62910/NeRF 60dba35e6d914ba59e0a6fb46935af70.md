# NeRF

- To render NeRF:
    - 1) March camera rays throug the scene to generate a sampled set of 3D points
    - 2) use those points and thir corresponding 2D viewing directions as input to the NN to produce an output set of colors & densities
    - 3) use classical volume rendering techniquest oaccumulate those colors and densities into a 2D image.
- Since NeRF process is naturally differentiable, can use gradient deescent to optimize this model by minimize the error b/n observed image and rendered.
- Limitations 보정:
    - Resolution 보정: Transform input 5D coordinates w/ **positional encoding** that enables the MLP to represent **higher frequency functions**
        - maps each input 5D coordinate into a higher dimensional space, which enables us to successfully optimize neural radiance fieldds to represent high-frequency scene content.
    - Inefficiency in number of samples 보정: **Hierarchical sampling** to reduce the number of queries required to sample
        - (allocates the MLP’s capacity towards space with visible scene content)
- Attractions of NeRF:
    - well suited for gradient-based optimization (Inherits the benefits of volumetric representations)
    - Overcomes the prohibitive storage costs of *discretized* voxel grids when modeling complex scenes at high-res.
- Characteristics of NeRF:
    - No CNN. Only basic MLP
    - Differentiable rendering procedure based on classical volume rendering.
